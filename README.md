## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Storage Architecture
The application uses browser Local Storage to persist data across sessions:

```javascript
// Storage schema
{
  goals: {
    daily: [],
    completed: [],
    settings: {}
  },
  calendar: {
    events: [],
    settings: {}
  },
  pomodoro: {
    settings: {
      workMinutes: 25,
      breakMinutes: 5
    },
    stats: {
      completedSessions: 0,
      totalMinutesWorked: 0
    }
  },
  bookmarks: {
    categories: [],
    items: [],
    settings: {}
